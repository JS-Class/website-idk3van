                <h3>General knowledge about me</h3>
                <p>
                    I was born in Defiance hospital and have lived
                    in Bryan, Ohio my entire life. I have one older sibiling,
                    my sister Krista<!--She's Lame-->. I have been homeschooled my entire life up until
                    college, and very much enjoyed being homeschooled.

            <h3>Work</h3>
                <p>
                    <span id ="first_job">first job was working as a dishwasher at Seasons
                    Coffee and Bistro in Bryan on the square.</span> My mom and,
                    some friends work there so it was a good first job.
                    When I turned 18 I got a job at CK Technologies working as an operator
                    where I later became a Manufacturing Engineering intern.
                    I still work as an intern at CK permorming maintenance on

                <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                <p>
                    I really enjoy music, not just the listening of it
                    but also the study of it. I know how to play piano and guitar
                    but I am mainly focused on improving my guitar skills right now.
                    I also like to study music theory as I find it interesting,
                    and it gives good guideline for creating music.
                </p>
