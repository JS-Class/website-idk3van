# Box Model
Add a floating element to your page (picture is easy)  
Use the margins, padding and borders as needed to format your
page in a pleasing manner.  
Be sure that elements aren't crowded
in their containers, but also, don't use excessive whitespace.   
Try to make the page look 'professional'.
